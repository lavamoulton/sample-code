A selection of past coding projects

The ch05 and support files are necessary resources utililzed from the textbook used in our java course. These were studied extensively during class and some edits were made, so they are updated to conform to these coding projects.

themaze.txt contains the text based maze in X's and O's, with the bottom right corner the exit and the top left the start. Input is acceptable if it is rectangular and the first two numbers indicate the dimensions of the maze.
